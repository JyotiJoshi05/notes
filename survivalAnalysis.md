# Survival Analysis
Time to Event Data Analysis
Duration Times
Time until the event happens from the start of the study
How long does a cab take to pick you
How much time it takes to deliver a letter
How much time for a person to become employed again after unemployement
Time to death of cancer patients
### GBSG2(German Breast Cancer Study Group 2) dataset. This dataset contains information on breast cancer patients and their survival.
### Why Survival Analysis
- Times are always positive
- Different measures are of interest
- Censoring almost always an issue
For analyses
- library("survival")
For pretty visualizations
library("survminer")
### The convention is that the censoring indicator is 1 if the event of interest happened.
```
# Load the UnempDur data
data("UnempDur", package ="Ecdat")

# Count censored and uncensored data
cens_employ_ft <- table(UnempDur$censor1)
cens_employ_ft

# Create barplot of censored and uncensored data
barplot(cens_employ_ft)

# Create Surv-Object
sobj <- Surv(UnempDur$spell, UnempDur$censor1)

# Look at 10 first elements
sobj[1:10]
```
### Survival analysis questions answered
- What is the probability that a breast cancer patient survives longer than 5 years?
- What is the typical waiting time for a cab?
- Out of 100 unemployed people, how many do we expect tohave a job again after 2 months?

Surv() is used to define the time-to-event outcome, survreg() can be used to estimate a Weibull model (see upcoming lessons), and with survfit() you can estimate survival curves, e.g. with the Kaplan-Meier technique.
```
```
# Create time and event data
time <- c(5, 6, 2, 4, 4)
event <- c(1, 0, 0, 1, 1)

# Compute Kaplan-Meier estimate
km <- survfit(Surv(time, event) ~ 1)
km

# Take a look at the structure
str(km)

# Create data.frame
data.frame(time = km$time, n.risk = km$n.risk, n.event = km$n.event,
  n.censor = km$n.censor, surv = km$surv)
  ```
 ```
 # Create dancedat data
dancedat <- data.frame(
  name = c("Chris", "Martin", "Conny", "Desi", "Reni", "Phil", 
    "Flo", "Andrea", "Isaac", "Dayra", "Caspar"),
  time = c(20, 2, 14, 22, 3, 7, 4, 15, 25, 17, 12),
  obs_end = c(1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0))

# Estimate the survivor function pretending that all censored observations are actual observations.
km_wrong <- survfit(Surv(time) ~ 1, data = dancedat)

# Estimate the survivor function from this dataset via kaplan-meier.
km <- survfit(Surv(time, obs_end) ~ 1, data = dancedat)

# Plot the two and compare
ggsurvplot_combine(list(correct = km, wrong = km_wrong))

# Kaplan-Meier estimate
km <- survfit(Surv(time, cens) ~ 1, data = GBSG2)

# plot of the Kaplan-Meier estimate
ggsurvplot(km)

# add the risk table to plot
ggsurvplot(km, risk.table = TRUE)

# add a line showing the median survival time
ggsurvplot(km, risk.table = TRUE, surv.median.line = "hv")

# Kaplan-Meier estimate
km <- survfit(Surv(time, cens) ~ 1, data = GBSG2)

# plot of the Kaplan-Meier estimate
ggsurvplot(km)

# add the risk table to plot
ggsurvplot(km, risk.table = TRUE)

# add a line showing the median survival time
ggsurvplot(km, risk.table = TRUE, surv.median.line = "hv")
```
```
# Weibull model
wb <- survreg(Surv(time, cens) ~ 1, data = GBSG2)

# Retrieve survival curve from model probabilities 
surv <- seq(.99, .01, by = -.01)

# Get time for each probability
t <- predict(wb, type = "quantile", p = 1 - surv, newdata = data.frame(1))

# Create data frame with the information
surv_wb <- data.frame(time = t, surv = surv)

# Look at first few lines of the result
head(surv_wb)

# Weibull model
wb <- survreg(Surv(time, cens) ~ 1, data = GBSG2)

# Retrieve survival curve from model
surv <- seq(.99, .01, by = -.01)

# Get time for each probability
t <- predict(wb, type = "quantile", p = 1 - surv, newdata = data.frame(1))

# Create data frame with the information needed for ggsurvplot_df
surv_wb <- data.frame(time = t, surv = surv, 
  upper = NA, lower = NA, std.err = NA)

# Plot
ggsurvplot_df(fit = surv_wb, surv.geom = geom_line)
